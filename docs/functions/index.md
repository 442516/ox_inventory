Ox Inventory is organised into separate files which are individually loaded and stored in a single environment through modules.  
While there are exceptions, most functions are included in modules and can only be accessed by including a reference to the module locally.


This section will provide details on several functions that are utilised in several modules or available to use in other resources as exports.  
More specialised functions will be detailed as part of documentation for a specific module.

!!! attention
	If the documentation for a function does not include an export then it is only intended for internal use.
