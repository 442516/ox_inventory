Functions are loaded with modules, they can only be used inside the inventory resource itself, the functions that you can use outside of the inventory resource are **exported**.

If a function is in the docs, but isn't defined that it's exported, then you **can't** use it outside the inventory.

Before using any modules make sure that the module you are trying to use the function from is loaded into the file.
