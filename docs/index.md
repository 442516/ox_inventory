# ox_inventory

## Requirements

You need these before installing the inventory:

- [oxmysql](https://github.com/overextended/oxmysql)

## Editing the framework

The only framework that the inventory is compatible with is **ESX Legacy**. Other versions of ESX are **not** supported.

Since the inventory isn't compatible with the framework out of the box, you are going to need to make some changes to it.

For ease of use we would recommend using [our fork]() of ESX.

Otherwise you can find the required changes to the framework [here]().
